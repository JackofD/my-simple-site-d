# Web Development Best Practices

As web development continues to evolve, following best practices becomes increasingly important. Here are some key principles to keep in mind.

## Performance First

Always optimize your web applications for performance:

- Minimize HTTP requests
- Optimize images
- Use lazy loading
- Implement caching strategies

## Accessibility Matters

Make your websites accessible to everyone:

- Use semantic HTML
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Maintain proper color contrast

Remember: good accessibility benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.
